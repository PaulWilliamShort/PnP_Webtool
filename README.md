# Pen and Paper Webtool
This Pen and Paper Webtool is created for playing Pen and Paper adventures online. 
It features rolling dice, pulling cards, editing your Characters stats, abilities and inventory and automatically storing it in a SQLite Database.
This Project will not feature a chat or VoIP for communication and requires a third party software for this purpose.
